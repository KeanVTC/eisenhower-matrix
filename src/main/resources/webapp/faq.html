  <sl-details summary="What is the Eisenhower Matrix?" style="margin-bottom: 12px">
    The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, is a tool used to prioritize tasks based on their level of importance and urgency.
    It was developed by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower">President Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and is designed to help individuals and organizations make better decisions about
    how to allocate their time and resources. It was later popularized by Stephen Covey's book,
    <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    The matrix consists of four quadrants: important and urgent, important but not urgent, urgent but not important,
    and neither urgent nor important. Tasks that are important and urgent should be completed first, followed by tasks that are important but not urgent.
    Tasks that are urgent but not important should be delegated or eliminated, and tasks that are neither urgent nor important should be avoided.
    <br/><br/>
    Using the Eisenhower Matrix can help you focus on the tasks that are most important and valuable, and avoid wasting time and energy on tasks
    that are not as crucial.

  <sl-details summary="How to use effectively the Eisenhower Matrix?" style="margin-bottom: 12px">
    Tasks that are both urgent and important require immediate action. These tasks typically have visible deadlines and consequences for delay in taking action. These tasks can be either externally imposed or ones that you have procrastinated on, but they require a crisis mode response.
    <br/><br/>
    Tasks that are not urgent but important contribute to the achievement of long-term goals. These tasks may not have a deadline or end date, which can make it tempting to prioritize more urgent tasks instead. However, these tasks have a significant impact on your long-term effectiveness in achieving your goals.
    <br/><br/>
    Tasks that are urgent but not important can be described as busy work. These tasks are often based on expectations set by others and do not contribute to the achievement of your long-term goals.
    <br/><br/>
    Tasks that are neither urgent nor important are time-wasting activities that should be eliminated. These tasks do not contribute to progress towards your goals and can consume large amounts of time.

    <a href="https://todoist.com/fr/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix">Here is an article</a> that provides more detailed information on how to determine which tasks belong in which quadrants. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide how you wish to prioritize your tasks.

  <sl-details summary="What is this website? Is it really free?" style="margin-bottom: 12px">
    This website was created because its author did not find an Eisenhower matrix editor that suited its needs, hence he created
    his own and made it available for free and <a href="https://github.com/antoinechampion/eisenhower-matrix">open-source</a>.
  </sl-details>
  <sl-details summary="How to use the editor?" style="margin-bottom: 12px">
    The first step is to create an account on the <a href="/">home page</a>.
    <br/> You will then be redirected to the matrix editor. On the bottom of the page, you will see a 'Plus' button to create
    a new task. You can drag your task on the desired quadrant of the board based on its priority. You can delete your
    task using the 'Minus' button. To create a memo document and attach it to a task, select a task and click on the 'Document' button.

  <sl-details summary="What are the alternative to this website?" style="margin-bottom: 12px">
    Other matrix editors can be found online:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://miro.com/templates/priority-matrix/">Miro</a>,
        <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/templates/eisenhower-matrix">Lucidchart</a>,
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/fr/templates/eisenhower-matrix-template/">Figma</a>...:
        Those are not standalone apps but templates for diagram building applications.
        They offer the best alternatives, with a polished user experience. However, their free tier is
        often very limited, and there is no a way to easily attach a memo document to a task.

      <li>
        <a href="https://appfluence.com/">Appfluence</a>: Another matrix editor with a solid free tier.
        However, you can't drag your post-its freely on the board: you instead need to order them sequentially.

        <a href="https://www.eisenhower.me/">Eisenhower.me</a>: Paid app for mobile.
        You can't drag your tasks freely on the board, you can't attach documents.
